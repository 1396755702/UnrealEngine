Download the Oculus Mobile SDK version 0.4.0.

Copy the complete VRLib directory (including the actual VRLib folder) from the SDK into this location such that this directory looks like:

	VRLib/
	ConfigureSDK.bat
	gearvr_sdk_install_readme.txt

Make sure you have an android build environment set up including the SDK and NDK.

Run ConfigureSDK.bat from a command prompt and make sure there are no errors.
