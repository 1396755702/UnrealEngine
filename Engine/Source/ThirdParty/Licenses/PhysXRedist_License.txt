NVIDIA LICENSE AGREEMENT

This License Agreement (this "Agreement") is entered into concurrently with the license 
agreement between Epic Products, Inc. ("Epic") and the licensee (the "Epic License Agreement") 
and is by and between NVIDIA Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("NVIDIA") having its 
principal place of business at 2701 San Tomas Expressway, Santa Clara, California  95050, and 
the Licensee under the Epic License Agreement ("Licensee").  Capitalized terms used in this 
Agreement but not otherwise defined herein will have the meanings assigned to them in the Epic 
License Agreement.

1.	EPIC LICENSE AGREEMENT.   Pursuant to the Epic License Agreement, Licensee 
desires to license from Epic the Licensed Technology.  The Licensed Technology includes the 
NVIDIA Software (as defined herein) as Third Party Software.  Licensee agrees to the terms of 
this Agreement by executing the Epic License Agreement.  The terms and conditions of the Epic 
License Agreement (except Sections 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9(a)(i), and 9(c)(i)(C), which will not apply) are 
hereby incorporated into and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth herein in their entirety 
and made applicable to NVIDIA and the NVIDIA Software, except as expressly provided herein.  
In the event of any contradiction between the terms of this document and the terms of the Epic 
License Agreement that are incorporated herein as applicable to the NVIDIA Software, the terms 
of this document will prevail.

2.	NVIDIA SOFTWARE; LICENSE; RESTRICTIONS.

2.1	"NVIDIA Software" means any PhysX software developed, maintained or owned by 
NVIDIA included as Third Party Software in the Licensed Technology.  

2.2	NVIDIA grants to Licensee the right to use, market and distribute the Licensed 
Technology incorporating NVIDIA Software solely pursuant to the terms, conditions and 
restrictions set forth in the Epic License Agreement (as incorporated herein, and as applicable to 
the NVIDIA Software) and the exceptions and additional terms, conditions and restrictions set 
forth in this Agreement, provided that (a) the NVIDIA Software is afforded the same level of 
protection as the Licensed Technology, and used only as use of the Licensed Technology is 
permitted under the Epic License Agreement, and (b) the terms of the Epic License Agreement 
providing rights to Epic will be enforceable by NVIDIA with respect to Licensee's use of the 
NVIDIA Software (except those provisions of the Epic License Agreement not incorporated 
herein, or any provisions regarding payment of royalties or license fees).

2.3	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Epic License Agreement and regarding 
Licensee's obligations with respect to any NVIDIA Software provided in Source Code form, 
Licensee agrees to promptly disclose and deliver to NVIDIA any modifications to such Source 
Code, including, with respect to bugs or errors, a detailed description of the bug or error that 
necessitated such modifications.  Any such modifications will be owned by NVIDIA and will be 
NVIDIA Software subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions of this Agreement.  The 
foregoing notwithstanding Licensee's obligation to disclose and deliver to NVIDIA any such 
Source Code Modifications in Source Code form and NVIDIA's ownership right in the same are 
subject to Licensee's contractual and confidentiality obligations to other parties.  If, for example, 
Licensee modifies the NVIDIA Licensed Software in Source Code form to operate on a 
proprietary hardware platform not supported by NVIDIA and has a contractual nondisclosure 
obligation for that platform, Licensee will not be required to disclose that code to NVIDIA and 
NVIDIA will not own that code.  For the sake of clarity the parties agree it is the intent of this 
section to grant Licensee the right to make any modification to the NVIDIA Licensed Software in 
Source Code form as used in games and titles only at any time Licensee sees fit for any reason 
Licensee deems necessary, even if the modifications result in an incompatibility with NVIDIA 
Hardware Integration Elements.  Nothing herein or in the Epic License Agreement permits 
Licensee to distribute the NVIDIA Licensed Software pursuant to an Open Source License.  
"Open Source License" means a software license that requires as a condition of use, modification, 
and/or distribution of such software that the NVIDIA Licensed Software be licensed, disclosed or 
distributed in Source Code form at no charge.

3.	PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; NOTICES.  Licensee acknowledges and agrees that 
NVIDIA and its licensors are the sole and exclusive owners of the trademarks, copyrights and 
other intellectual property rights associated with NVIDIA and the NVIDIA Software and all 
derivative works thereof.  Licensee will reproduce faithfully all of NVIDIA's and its licensors' 
trademark, copyright and other proprietary notices on any copies of the NVIDIA Software and 
will comply at all times with NVIDIA's policies in effect from time to time with respect thereto.  
The foregoing notwithstanding Licensee is not be required to publicly display as embedded in the 
games products of each any trademark, copyright and other proprietary notices that appear in the 
NVIDIA Licensed Software), Except as expressly licensed to Licensee hereunder, NVIDIA and 
its licensors retain all right, title and interest to the NVIDIA Software, and to any modifications 
made by Licensee or any third party to the NVIDIA Software, and Licensee agrees to execute 
any necessary documents to effectuate the terms of this section.  Licensee agrees that any 
feedback it may supply to NVIDIA regarding the NVIDIA Software will become the sole 
property of NVIDIA to use as it sees fit.  

4.	LICENSEE INDEMNITY.  Licensee will indemnify and defend NVIDIA and its 
affiliates and its and their respective directors, officers, employees and agents from, and hold 
them harmless against, any loss, damage, liability and expense (including reasonable attorneys' 
fees) suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with any demand, claim or legal 
proceeding arising from a breach by Licensee of its obligations with respect to the NVIDIA 
Software.

5.	NO WARRANTY.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE CONTRARY IN 
THE EPIC LICENSE AGREEMENT,  LICENSEE UNDERSTANDS AND AGREES THAT 
THE NVIDIA SOFTWARE IS NOT WARRANTED TO LICENSEE TO BE FREE FROM 
DEFECTS AND IS PROVIDED TO LICENSEE "AS IS."  NVIDIA EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS 
ALL WARRANTIES WITH RESPECT TO THE NVIDIA SOFTWARE, WHETHER SUCH 
WARRANTIES ARE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE 
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR 
PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.

6.	LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING TO THE 
CONTRARY IN THE EPIC LICENSE AGREEMENT, NVIDIA WILL NOT BE LIABLE

CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE 
THEORY FOR ANY (A) INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES, (B) LOST PROFITS, LOST BUSINESS OR LOST OR CORRUPTED DATA, OR 
(C) COST OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE SOFTWARE, TECHNOLOGY, GOODS 
OR SERVICES, EVEN IF THE REMEDIES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAIL 
OF THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE AND EVEN IF NVIDIA HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  IN NO EVENT WILL NVIDIA'S LIABILITY TO 
LICENSEE ARISING UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EXCEED $50 IN THE AGGREGATE.

7.	CONFIDENTIALITY.  The confidentiality obligations of Licensee set forth in Section 
8 of the Epic License Agreement will apply to this Agreement and the NVIDIA Software to the 
same extent such obligations are applicable to the Confidential Information, and will be fully 
enforceable by NVIDIA.

8.	GOVERNING LAW.  This Agreement and the rights of NVIDIA with respect to the 
NVIDIA Software set forth in this Agreement or in the Epic License Agreement will be governed 
by and construed under the laws of the State of California and the United States without regard to 
the conflicts of law provisions thereof and without regard to the United Nations Convention on 
Contracts for the International Sale of Goods.  The parties hereby submit to the exclusive
