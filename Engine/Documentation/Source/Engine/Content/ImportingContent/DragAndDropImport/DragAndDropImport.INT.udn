## Dragging-and-Dropping Content into the Project

After locating your content, **drag-and-drop** the files from your Explorer menu into the Content Browser's file box (pictured below).

1.	Click **OK** to accept the **T_Rock_04_n.TGA** normal map's settings (pictured above).

	[REGION:warning]
	UE4 batch imports [supported](Engine/Content/Types/Textures/Importing "Click HERE to learn more about supported images.") image files for you.
	
	If you see the following pop-up message:
	
	![](TextureImportMessage.png)
	
	UE4 just prevented you from importing an unsupported image file.
	
	Also, if you see the following pop-up message:
	
	![](nonpoweoftwowarning.png)
	
	UE4 is telling you that odd-sized images aren't streamed or mipmapped.

1.	Unsaved assets are marked with an asterisk (pictured below).

## Verifying Imported Assets

It's good practice to verify that ** *.uasset files ** were imported properly onto the hard disk.

1.	Inside the editor, **right-click** the **'Content'** folder to open the **Folder Options** dialog box (pictured below).

	![](FolderDialogBox_UI.png)

1.	Under **Folder Options**, **click 'Show In Explorer'** (pictured below).

	![](ShowInExplorer_Selection.png)

1.	With Explorer open, verify that UE4 created the corresponding ** *.uasset files **  for your project (pictured below).
