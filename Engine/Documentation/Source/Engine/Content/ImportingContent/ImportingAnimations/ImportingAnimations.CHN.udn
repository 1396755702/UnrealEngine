[REGION:note]
Before getting started: Make sure you have access to a 3D modeling application. We are using **3DS Max and Maya** to illustrate this lesson's goal.
[/REGION]

Content creators can import animations into Unreal Engine from external 3D modeling applications.

## Goal

The focus of this guide is to show developers how to import animations from external 3D modeling programs.

## Objectives

After going through this tutorial, developers will know the following:

*	How to export animations from external 3D modeling applications.
*	How to import animations into Unreal Editor from external 3D modeling applications.

[REGION:warning]
The UE4 FBX import pipeline uses **FBX 2014**. Using a different version during export may result in incompatibilities.
[/REGION]

## Exporting Animations

Animations must be exported individually with one animation per skeletal mesh in a single file.

## Importing Animations

Unreal's FBX animation import pipeline allows content developers to import animations with or without skeletal meshes.

### Importing Animation with Skeletal Mesh

1.	Inside the editor, **click** the **Import** button (pictured below).

	![](ImportButton_UI.png)

1.	Locate and **select** the FBX file you want to import (example pictured below).

	![](ImportDialogBox.png)

1.	**Click Open** to begin importing the FBX file you want to import to your project (example pictured above).

1.	Update the appropriate settings in the **FBX Import Options** dialog.

	[REGION:note]
	Default settings should be sufficient when importing a mesh that doesn't share an existing skeleton. When importing LODs, the name of the imported mesh will follow default [Naming Conventions](Engine/Content/FBX/ImportOptions#NamingConventions). Refer to our  [FBX Import Dialog](Engine/Content/FBX/ImportOptions) documentation for additional information about all of the settings.
	[/REGION]

1.	**Clicking Import** or **Import All** adds your meshes to the project (pictured above).

	[REGION:warning]
	If you encounter a warning (example warning pictured below), refer to our [](Shared/Editor/FbxErrors) documentation for detailed information on how to troubleshoot the warning.

	[/REGION]

1.	The imported skeletal mesh and animations appear inside the **Content Browser** if the process succeeded (example pictured below).

	[REGION:note]
	By default, the AnimationSequence created to hold the imported animation is named after the skeleton's root bone.
	[/REGION]

### Importing Animation without Skeletal Mesh

[REGION:note]
Unreal allows content creators to import multiple animations in a single FBX file; however, many DCC tools (such as 3ds Max and Maya) do no support the saving of multiple animations to a single file. If you export from supporting applications (such as Motion Builder), Unreal will import all of the animations contained in that file.
[/REGION]

Before beginning this section, you'll need an **AnimationSequence** to import the animation into. Animation sequences can be created through the **Content Browser** or directly in the **AnimationSequence Editor**.

1.	Inside the editor, **click** the **Import** button (pictured below).

	![](ImportButton_UI.png)

1.	Locate and **select** the FBX file you want to import (example pictured below).

	![](ImportDialogBox.png)

1.	**Click Open** to begin importing the FBX file you want to import to your project (example pictured above).

1.	Update the appropriate settings in the **FBX Import Options** dialog.

	[REGION:note]
	Default settings should be sufficient when importing a mesh that doesn't share an existing skeleton. When importing LODs, the name of the imported mesh will follow default [Naming Conventions](Engine/Content/FBX/ImportOptions#NamingConventions). Refer to our  [FBX Import Dialog](Engine/Content/FBX/ImportOptions) documentation for additional information about all of the settings.
	[/REGION]

	[REGION:warning]
	You must specify an existing skeleton when importing animations individually.
	[/REGION]

1.	The imported skeletal mesh and animations appear inside the **Content Browser** if the process succeeded (example pictured below).

	[REGION:note]
	By default, the AnimationSequence created to hold the imported animation is named after the skeleton's root bone.

[REGION:tip]
Refer to our [](Engine/Animation/NonUniformScale) documentation to learn how Unreal supports non-uniform scale animations.
