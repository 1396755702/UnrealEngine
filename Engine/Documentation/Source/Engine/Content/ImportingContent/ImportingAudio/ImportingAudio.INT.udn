[REGION:note]
Unreal Engine currently imports uncompressed, little endian, 16-bit Wave (WAV) files at any sample rate (although, we recommend sample rates of 44.1 kHz or 22.05 kHz).
[/REGION]

## Goal

Content creators can import single and multi-channel audio files into their project directories.

## Objectives

After going through this tutorial, developers will know the following:

*	Where to locate the Content Browser's **Import** function.
*	How to import single audio files.
*	How to reference the multi-channel audio extension table.
*	How to import multi-channel audio.
*	How to verify that assets were properly imported into the project folder.

## Locating the Content Browser's Import Button

1.	The **Import** button is located inside Unreal Editor's **Content Browser** (click the image below).

## Referencing the Multi-Channel Audio Extension Table

Prior to importing multi-channel audio, developers should reference the following table when naming their ** *.WAV ** files.

[REGION:raw]
|                   | Extension | 4.0         | 5.1         | 6.1         | 7.1         |  
| ---               | ---       | ---         | ---         | ---         | ---         | 
| **FrontLeft**     | _fl       |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   | 
| **FrontRight**    | _fr       |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   | 
| **FrontCenter**   | _fc       |             |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   | 
| **LowFrequency**  | _lf       |             |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   | 
| **SideLeft**      | _sl       |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   | 
| **SideRight**     | _sr       |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   | 
| **BackLeft**      | _bl       |             |             |  &#x2713;   |  &#x2713;   |  
| **BackRight**     | _br       |             |             |             |  &#x2713;   |

[REGION:note]
The following steps demonstrate a specific use-case for importing a 4.0 surround sound asset into the editor. Refer to our [](Engine/Audio) documentation for information on sample rates, audio specifications, and best practices when importing audio into UE4.
[/REGION]

1.	After exporting your multi-channel sound asset, verify that your audio files are named according to the above-listed Multi-Channel Audio Extension Table (4.0 example pictured below).

	![](VerifyMultiChannelNames.png)

	*Extension requirements for 5.1, 6.1, and 7.1 channel surround sound are found in the Multi-Channel Audio Extension Table.*

## Importing Multi-Channel Audio

[REGION:note]
Exporting a multi-channel sound asset will create a mono ** .WAV ** file for each channel with the above speaker extension naming convention.
[/REGION]

1.	Inside the editor, **click** the **Import** button (pictured below).

	![](ImportButtonUI_Multi.png)

1.	Locate and **select** your ** *.WAV ** files (example pictured below).

	![](ImportDialogBox_Multi.png)

1.	**Click Open** to begin importing the audio file to your project (pictured above).

1.	An import progress bar pops-up (pictured below).

	![](ImportingProgressBar_Multi.png)

1.	A four channel sound asset (named "Surround") appears inside the **Content Browser** once UE4 successfully imports the audio files (example pictured below).

	![](UnsavedSurroundSoundAsset.png)

1.	The unsaved sound asset is marked with an asterisk (pictured above).

1.	**Click** the **Save All** button to save your imported sound asset.

	![](SaveAllButtonSurround.png)

1.	A **Save Content** dialog box appears (pictured below). **Click Save Selected** to save your imported asset.

	![](SaveContentDialogSurround.png)

1.	UE4 removes the asterisk from your saved asset (pictured below).

	![](SavedSurroundSoundAsset.png)

1.	**Hover over** the saved asset inside the **Content Browser** to view a summary of the sound asset's properties (pictured below).

	![](HoverOverSurround.png)

## Verifying Imported Assets

It's good practice to verify that ** *.uasset files ** were imported properly onto the hard disk.

1.	Inside the editor, **right-click** the **'Content'** folder to open the **Folder Options** dialog box (pictured below).

	![](FolderDialogBox_UI.png)

1.	Under **Folder Options**, **click 'Show In Explorer'** (pictured below).

	![](ShowInExplorer_Selection.png)

1.	With Explorer open, verify that UE4 created the corresponding ** *.uasset files **  for your project (pictured below).

Now that we've reached the end of this tutorial, you've learned how to:

&#x2713;	Locate the Content Browser's **Import** function.  
&#x2713;	Import single audio files.  
&#x2713;	Reference the multi-channel audio extension table.  
&#x2713;	Import multi-channel audio.  
&#x2713;	Verify that assets were properly imported to the project folder.
