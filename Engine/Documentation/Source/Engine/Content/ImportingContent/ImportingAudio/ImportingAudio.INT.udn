## Importing Multi-Channel Audio



## Verifying Imported Assets

It's good practice to verify that ** *.uasset files ** were imported properly onto the hard disk.

1.	From inside the editor, **right-click** the **'Content'** folder to open the **Folder Options** dialog box (pictured below).

1.	Under **Folder Options**, **click 'Show In Explorer'** (pictured below).
