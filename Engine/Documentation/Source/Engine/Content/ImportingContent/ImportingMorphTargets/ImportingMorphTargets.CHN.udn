[REGION:note]
Before getting started: Make sure you have access to a 3D modeling application. We are using **3DS Max and Maya** to illustrate this lesson's goal.
[/REGION]

Content creators can import morph targets into Unreal Engine from external 3D modeling applications.

## Goal

The focus of this guide is to show developers how to import morph targets from external 3D modeling applications.

## Objectives

After going through this tutorial, developers will know the following:

*	How Unreal's FBX pipeline names morph targets.
*	How to set-up morph targets.
*	How to export morph targets.
*	How to import morph targets.
*	How to verify that morph targets were imported properly.

## Morph Target Naming

Unreal names morph targets in correlation with the originating application.

	The name will be the name of the blendshape added to the name of the blendshape node, i.e. `[BlendShapeNode]_[BlendShape]`.

## Importing Morph Targets
[REGION:note]
This guide teaches developers how to import morph targets with skeletal meshes. Refer to our [](Engine/Content/FBX/MorphTargets) documentation to learn more about importing morph targets independently from skeletal meshes.
[/REGION]

1.	Inside the editor, **click** the **Import** button (pictured below).

	![](ImportButton_UI.png)

1.	Locate and **select** the FBX file you want to import (example pictured below).

	![](ImportDialogBox.png)

1.	**Click Open** to begin importing the FBX file to your project (pictured above).

1.	Inside the **FBX Import Options** dialog box, choose the appropriate settings. (example pictured below).

	![](ImportMorphTargetsOption.png)

	[REGION:warning]
	Default settings should be sufficient; however, make sure that **Import Morph Targets** is enabled (pictured above).
	[/REGION]

1.	**Click Import** or **Import All** to import the mesh to your project.

	![](FBX_DialogBox.png)
	
	[REGION:warning]
	If you encounter a warning (example warning pictured below), refer to our [](Shared/Editor/FbxErrors) documentation for detailed information on how to troubleshoot the warning.
	
	![](PotentialWarning.png)
	[/REGION]

1.	The imported mesh appears inside the **Content Browser** if the process succeeded (example pictured below).

	![](ImportedSKMesh.png)

## Verifying Morph Targets

1.	**Double-click** the imported mesh to view it in **Persona** (pictured below).

	Using the **Morph Target Previewer** tab, adjust the strength of the imported morph target to confirm that it's working properly.
