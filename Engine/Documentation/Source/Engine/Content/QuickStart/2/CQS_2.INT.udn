%Steps%

At this point, you should have created a new UE4 **Project** (pictured below).

There are a few ways to add content to your UE4 project:

>1. [Using the Content Browser's **Import** function.](#Bookmark1)
>2. [**Dragging** files from your hard drive into the Content Browser.](#Bookmark2)
>3. [**Saving** files into the Project directory from external programs (e.g. Photoshop).](#Bookmark3)

## 1. Importing with the Content Browser

(#Bookmark1)

The **Content Browser** is located in the lower-left corner of the Editor interface (pictured below).

![](ContentBrowser.jpg)

**Clicking** on the **Content Browser's** ![](ImportButton.jpg) button opens a file dialog, enabling you to add assets to your project.

## 2. Importing using Click and Drag

(#Bookmark2)

**Dragging** files from your hard drive into the **Content Browser** (pictured below) is another way of adding content to your project.

### When Importing Meshes

![](FBXImportOptions.png)

UE4 prompts you to define import options for FBX/OBJ files (pictured above).

### When Importing Textures

UE4 batch imports [__supported__](Engine/Content/Types/Textures/Importing "Click HERE to learn more about supported images.") image files for you.

If you see the following pop-up message:

![](TextureImportMessage.png)

UE4 just prevented you from importing an unsupported image file.

Also, if you see the following pop-up message:

![](nonpoweoftwowarning.png)

UE4 is telling you that odd-sized images aren't streamed or mipmapped.

## 3. Importing from an External Program

(#Bookmark3)

Although we're using Photoshop in this example, you can follow along with any image editor of your choice.

### While Running Photoshop

Click **File** and **Save As**.

### Inside the ï¿½Save As' Dialog Box

Locating your UE4 Project Directory and Content folder, enter a filename (using a supported format), then click Save.

### Browsing to your Content Folder

You'll see that your file has been added.

If the Editor is open, the Processing outstanding content changes message will appear (pictured below).

### Reviewing your Content Browser

Confirm that UE4 created a corresponding *.uasset file.

At this point, you've learned how to add content using three methods.

* [Importing with the **Content Browser**.](#Bookmark1)
* [Importing using **Click and Drag**.](#Bookmark2)
* [Importing from an **External Program**.](#Bookmark3)

[REGION:tip]
*Naming conventions matter! Be consistent when naming files.*
[/REGION]

<!--
If you have assets to import, you can jump to the [Mesh Preparation](#meshpreparation) section below. 

If you do not have any assets or access to a modeling package, you can download some sample assets below:

* [Sample Assets](Engine/Content/QuickStart/3/QuickStartSampleAssets.zip)

Extract these to a location on your computer then drag the **Basic_Asset1** and **Basic_Asset2** into the **Content** folder of your UE4 Project.

 From here, you can continue from **Step 4** below. 
 
[REGION:note]
 The naming convention and file structure may look slightly different depending upon your asset name and project location.
