Materials are assets applied to meshes, contributing to a scene's visual aesthetic.

Materials are created with two common methods:

* Relying on **existing textures** to create materials.
* Using the **Material Editor**.

##Creating Materials with Textures

1.	Navigate to your **Content Browser** where your sample assets are located. **Right-click** on **T_Rock_04_D** and choose **Create Material** from the **Texture Actions** menu (pictured below).

1.	Enter a name for your newly created **Material**.

1.	Your **Material** is now ready to be used.

1.	**Double-clicking** the Material will open the [__Material Editor__](Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor:description%") (pictured below).

	Our example uses a single Texture Sample node pointing to our **T_Rock_04_D** texture. Read our [__Material - How To__](Engine/Rendering/Materials/HowTo "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/HowTo:description%") documentation if you want to learn more about working with Material Nodes.

##Creating New Material with the Material Editor

1.	Navigate to your **Content Browser**, click **Add New**, and select **Material** (pictured below).

	_Alternatively, you can **Right-click** in an empty space within the **Content Browser.**_
	
1.	Enter a name for your newly created **Material**.

	![](materialNaming.jpg)

	_If you'd like to rename your material, Right-click on the asset and select Rename._

1.	**Double-clicking** the Material will open the Material Editor [__Material Editor__](Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor:description%") (pictured below).

	_At this point, the Material Editor only contains the **Main Material Node.**_

You've just created new materials for your project using two methods:

* Using **existing textures** to create new materials.
* Working in the **Material Editor** to create new materials.

[REGION:tip]
*Size your textures using powers of two.*

Now using what you know, create a new **Material** similar to this graph:

There is nothing fancy set on the Main Material node, this is just a simple plastic Material. 

Add the _Basic_Asset1_ to the level and apply the Material to it and update the Material to add a "Brick" Normal Map Texture.
