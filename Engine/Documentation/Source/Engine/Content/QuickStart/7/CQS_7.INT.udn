%Steps%

You can define a Material's color, shininess, transparency, and much more in the [__Material Editor__](Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor:description%").

Using the two textures you imported in the [__Creating Materials Section__](Engine/Content/QuickStart/6 "%Engine/Content/QuickStart/6:description%"), it's time to edit the **Rock Material** you created.

1.	**Select** the Main Material Node in the center of the Material Graph. The Material Editor will highlight the node for you when you select it (pictured below).

	![](mainNode.jpg)

	_It is the only node in the Graph area, named according to your Material._

1.	In the **Details Panel**, change the **Shading Model** from **Default Lit** to **Subsurface**.
	
	![](subsurfaceEnable.jpg)

1.	Selecting the **Subsurface Shading Model** enables two more pins in the Main Material Node: **Opacity** and **Subsurface Color** (pictured below).
	
	![](morePins.jpg)

1.	Now's the time to get your textures into the Graph. Hold the **'T'** key and **Left-click** inside the Editor's Graph area. A **Texture Sample** node should appear inside the graph.

1.	You'll want at least 2 textures. Repeat Step 4 until your graph looks like the image below.
	
	![](textureSampleNodes.jpg)

1.	Select one of the **Texture Sample Nodes** and locate the **Details Panel** under the **Material Expression Texture Base** category (pictured below). 
	
	![](textureNone.jpg)

	Under the texture property, **Left-click** the pull down menu labeled "None" and select the color texture named **T_Rock_04_D**.

	_You can use the search field to locate the texture asset by entering **T_Rock_04_D** in the search field._

1.	Repeat Step 6 for the other **Texture Sample Node**, making sure to select the normal map texture named **T_Rock_04_n**.
	
	![](bothTexturesSelected.jpg)

	_The Material Graph should resemble the image pictured above._

1.	Connect the **T_Rock_04_D** Texture Sample's **Color pin (white)** to the Rock Material's **Base Color pin**.
	
	![](connectColorPin.jpg)

	_The newly connected white pin (pictured above) contains the Texture's color channels._

1.	Connect the **T_Rock_04_n** Texture Sample's **Normal pin (white)** to the Rock Material's **Normal pin**.
	
	![](connectNormalPin.jpg)

	_The newly connected **white pin** (pictured above) contains information for the texture's **Normal Map**_.

1.	The **Preview** should look similar to the image pictured below.
	
	![](preview_DN.jpg)

1.	Hold the **'1'** key and **Left-click** in the Graph Panel to create three (**3**) **Constant** nodes.
	
	![](Constants.jpg)

	_The **Constant** node (pictured above) is a modifiable scalar float variable._

1.	Hold the **'3'** key and **Left-click** in the Graph Panel to create one (**1**) **Constant3Vector**.
	
	![](Constant3.jpg)

	_The **Constant3Vector** node (pictured above) is a modifiable vector corresponding to color without an alpha channel._

	Read our [__Constant Expression__](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant "%Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant:description%") documentation if you want to learn more about working with **Constant Expressions**.

1.	Your nodes should be arranged so that connections can be easily made without wires crossing or sliding beneath each other (pictured below).
	
	![](MatConstantsAdded.jpg)

1.	Connect all of the **Constant** nodes and the **Constant3Vector** to corresponding pins in the **Rock Material** node (pictured below).
	
	![](allNodesConnectedNoVal.jpg)

1.	Change the values of each **Constant** and **Constant3Vector** by updating their **Value** parameter in the **Details** panel.
	
	* Metallic/Specular Value = 0.0
	* Roughness Value = 0.8
	* Opacity Value = 0.95
	* Subsurface Color = Red(1,0,0)
	
	![](allConnectedAllAdjusted.jpg)

1.	The Preview should look similar to the image pictured below.
	
	![](preview_All.jpg)

1.	Make sure to **Save** your material **before exiting** the Material Editor.

You're almost done! You've just used the **Material Editor** to create a custom Rock Material.
