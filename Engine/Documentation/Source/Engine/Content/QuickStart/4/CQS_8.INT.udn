You're now ready to bring things together!

The objective of this step is to apply our **Material** to the Static Mesh we imported. Specifically, you'll learn how to:

* [Set an Actor's Default Material](#Bookmark1)
* [Change Materials used by an Actor](#Bookmark2)

## Setting an Actor's Default Material

(#Bookmark1)

This section will show you how to set a **Static Mesh Actor's** default material. The default material will be used whenever an **Actor** is placed in the level.

1.	Inside the **Content Browser**, double-click the asset you imported earlier in this guide.

	The [Static Mesh Editor](Engine/Content/Types/StaticMeshes/Editor "%Engine/Content/Types/StaticMeshes/Editor:description%") will load your asset for editing (pictured below).

1.	Clicking the **Save** button first, close the **Material Editor**.

	_The specified **Material** will be used anytime you place this asset in the level._

## Changing Material Used by an Actor

(#Bookmark2)

When we placed a **Static Mesh** object in our level, we created an instance of our object (an [Actor](Engine/Actors "%Engine/Actors:description%")). For every instance of that **Actor**, we're able to specify its **Material**.

Here's how you change a **Static Mesh Actor's** Material.

1.	Select your **Static Mesh Actor**.

1.	Inside the pop-up menu, select a different Material.

You've just applied materials to your Static Mesh Actors by:

* Setting your Actor's Default Material
* Changing Material used by your Actor
