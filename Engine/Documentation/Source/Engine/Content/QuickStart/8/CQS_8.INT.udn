You're now ready to bring things together!

The objective of this step is to apply our **Material** to the Static Mesh we imported. Specifically, you'll learn how to:

* [Set an Actor's default material.](#Bookmark1)
* [Change materials used by an Actor.](#Bookmark2)

##Setting an Actor's Default Material

(#Bookmark1)

This section will show you how to set a Static Mesh Actor�s default material. The default material will be used whenever an Actor is placed in the level.

1.	From the **Content Browser**, **Double-click** the asset you imported earlier in this guide.

	The [__Static Mesh Editor__](Engine/Content/Types/StaticMeshes/Editor "%Engine/Content/Types/StaticMeshes/Editor:description%") will load your asset for editing (pictured below).

	_The specified **Material** will be used anytime you place this asset in the level._

##Changing Material Used by an Actor

(#Bookmark2)

When we placed a **Static Mesh** object in our level, we created an instance of our object (an [__Actor__](Engine/Actors "%Engine/Actors:description%")). For every instance of that Actor, we're able to specify its Material.

Here�s how you change a **Static Mesh Actor's** Material.

1.	Select your **Static Mesh Actor**.

1.	From the **Details** panel, locate the **Materials** section, and click the **Materials** dropdown menu.

1.	From the pop-up menu, select a different Material.

	_Downloading [__Starter Content__](Engine/Content/Packs "%Engine/Content/Packs:description%") will give you additional Material options._

1.	Alternatively, drag-and-drop a new Material onto the **Static Mesh Actor** (pictured below).

You've just applied materials to your Static Mesh Actors by:

* Setting your Actor's **Default Material**.
* **Changing Material** used by your Actor.

We've now reached the end of the Artist Quick Start Guide. By now, you should have the skills needed to:

* **Setup a Project.**
* **Create Materials.**
* **Apply Materials to a Static Mesh Actor.**

Awesome work!
