This is what you'll see when you launch UE4 (pictured below).

Setting up your project is easy!

1.	Click the **New Project** tab from the Unreal Project Browser. 
1.	Click the **Blueprint** tab and select **Blank**.
1.	Select the following **settings**:
	* **Desktop / Console**
	* **Maximum Quality**
	* **With Starter Content**
1.	Select a location for your project to be stored: ![](ProjectLocation.png).
1.	Name your project: ![](ProjectName.png).
1.	Click on the **Create Project** button: ![](CreateProjectButton.png).

From now on, UE4 will save all of your content as a **Project** on the disk. As you complete this tutorial, UE4 organizes your meshes and textures.

The **Content Browser** (pictured above) is a great way to navigate through your project's directory structure.

You can also find content by navigating through the **Project** folder located on the hard drive (pictured below).

By now, you should be comfortable creating projects and browsing through content in UE4.

[REGION:tip]
*UE4 automatically imports content added to a Project's directory.*

## Content File Types

Almost every game will use content created externally to Unreal Engine 4. Given this, the editor supports importing a number of file formats for 3D, 2D, audio, and animation assets. For the purposes of this quick start guide, we will be focusing on 3D and 2D assets, specifically **Static Meshes** and **Textures**.

	[PARAM:description]
	[INCLUDE:Engine/Content/FBX#intro]

	In Unreal Engine 4, the FBX format is used for **Static Meshes**, **Skeletal Meshes**, and **Animation Sequences**.

	For more information on the FBX pipeline, see: [**%Engine/Content/FBX:title%**](Engine/Content/FBX).

	[PARAM:description]
	Image files imported into Unreal Engine 4 are primarily used in **Materials**, but can also be used in the Landscape Editor and various paint tools as height maps or paint brush masks. In some cases, they can be applied directly to the HUD.

	Some formats have very specific uses. The file types of .hdr and some formats of .dds are used for **Cubemaps** while .raw files can be imported as a height map into the Landscape Editor.

	For more information on supported image types, see: [**%Engine/Content/Types/Textures/Importing:title%**](Engine/Content/Types/Textures/Importing).

In the next step, we will be going over the import of a few files, including an FBX file and a few images to be used in a material.
