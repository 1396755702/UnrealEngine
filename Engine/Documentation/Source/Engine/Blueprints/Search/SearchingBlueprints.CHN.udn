## Searching Blueprints

When in the Blueprint Editor, you can click on **Search** in the **Toolbar** or use **Ctrl+F** to bring up the [Find Results](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/FindResults) window.
Here, you can search your Blueprints for nodes, pins, pin values, graphs, variables, and variable values that match your search query. You are also able to search animation graphs. 

Right-clicking on a node in a Blueprint or an element in the **My Blueprint** window and clicking on **Find References** will also open the **Find Results** window, with the search
field populated with the name of the element as well as the MemberGuid of the element. This ensures that you are searching for that specific variable or function, even if you have multiple
instances of that name in other parts of your project. 

Searching is an asynchronous process, meaning it will not prevent you from using the editor as the search completes. You can also make multiple searches in different Blueprints at the same time. 
It leverages the Derived Data Cache (DDC) for the searchable data, so when Blueprints are updated, their information is refreshed. 

By default, this tool searches your current Blueprint, but by unchecking the **Find in Current Blueprint Only** checkbox, you can search all Blueprints in the project. When Blueprints are not indexed in the system, it will inform you, as in the below image:

Indexing all is a slow process, as it loads all un-indexed Blueprints to cache searchable data. It is not recommended to index all Blueprints with unsaved data. However, no Blueprints have to be resaved as part of the indexing process. 
If you click on **Index All** and are connected to the shared DDC, the indexing will be available to all users on the shared DDC. 

When indexing un-indexed Blueprints while connected to source control, you can either check out all Blueprints to make the indexing permanent, or perform a temporary index that will last for your current Unreal Editor
session.

## Advanced Search Syntax

Filters are an advanced search feature for targeting searches to specific subsets of data in Blueprints. 
For example, you can isolate only Blueprints that have nodes named something specfic or properties with certain names and flags set.
 These can be nested and combined to form advanced queries for very specific needs. Certain filters can only be used within other filters, but all filters can be used as a starting point. 
 Below is a non-exhaustive list of searchable tags and with what sort of data that are used for. All tags can be searched for without the use of filters.
 
Some items can only be searched using tags to help prevent clutter when doing searches without tags. These items are marked below using (Explicit). Currently, filtering is limited to user-added member variables.

An example search string is `Nodes(Name=Coin)`, which will find all nodes in the Blueprint that contain "coin" in the name.

 PinCategory is the type of pin, "bool", "string", "Actor", "MyBlueprint". ObjectClass is the struct or object represented by the pin/variable/component.

### The All Subfilter

`All` is a special subfilter. When nested in another filter, it will allow any data contained within it to be tested against all children of any objects that pass the filter otherwise.

Example: `Graphs(Name=MyFunction && All(Return))`

Any graph that contains the name "MyFunction" will test all of its children (nodes, local variables, and pins) for the string "Return".
