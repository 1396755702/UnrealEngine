Description:How to get started using the animations and skeletal meshes in the Mixamo project.
version: 4.9

The 15 characters provided in the Mixamo Animation Pack can be migrated to your project, either as a Character Blueprint or as a combination of a Skeletal Mesh and Animation Blueprint.
The first method is a quick and easy way to drop a third-person character into your project, complete with movement controls and attacking. The second method allows you to change the 
look of a character you already have, or in different styles of templates, if the movement and inputs have similar setups to the Mixamo base character. 

[REGION:note]
If you would like to add all of the provided animations, meshes, and Blueprints to your project, you can [add the asset pack using the Launcher](Engine/Basics/AssetsAndPackages#assetpacks). The steps and notes below about changing the Game Mode to use the 
provided Blueprint, or swapping the Skeletal Mesh and Animation Blueprint in other types of projects, still apply. You just will not need to open the MixamoAnimPack project or migrate anything.
