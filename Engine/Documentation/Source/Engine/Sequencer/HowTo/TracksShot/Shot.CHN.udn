[REGION:warning]
This is a feature that is currently undergoing development and may not work as expected or may change in future revisions.
[/REGION]

The **Level Sequence** Editor (or **Sequencer** for short) is still in the early stages of development and must be enabled in order to access it. 
This guide will show you where you can access and enable Sequencer (as well as the **Sequence Recorder**) and open up the Sequencer Editor so that you can begin creating cinematics. 

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project. However, you can use any project you wish. 
[/REGION]

1.	With [**Sequencer**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\EnableSequencer) enabled, in the **Content Browser** click **Add New** and under **Animation** select **Level Sequence**. 




## End Result

After choosing a name and save location for your Level Sequence, the **Sequencer** Editor will automatically open. 


Inside the Sequencer Editor you can start adding different types of **Tracks** which you can use to craft your cinematic sequences. You can also use the **Sequence Recorder** to record content that will be used to automatically create new Level Sequences which you can edit inside Sequencer.
