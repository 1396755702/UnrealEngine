Sequencer is the successor to [**Matinee**](Engine\Matinee\) and gives users the ability to create in-game cinematics through a specialized multi-track editor. 
By creating **Level Sequences** and adding **Tracks**, users can define the make up of each Track which will define the content for their sequence. 
Tracks can consist of things like Animation (for animating a character), Transformation (moving things around in the scene like Camera), Audio (for including a music or sound effect), etc. 

This page covers the basics of the **Sequencer** Editor inside **Unreal Engine 4**. 

[REGION:note]
Sequencer is in the early stages of development and you will need to enable it before you can start working with it. Please see the [](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\EnableSequencer) page for more information.

##Level Sequences

The **Level Sequence** asset is similar to the **Matinee Actor** and must be created before you can begin working with Sequencer. 

You can create one from the **Toolbar** under **Cinematics** or from the **Content Browser** as seen below.
