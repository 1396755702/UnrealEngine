## Tool Bar

![](Toolbar.png)

What follows is a description of each of the toolbar buttons, from left to right as they appear on the toolbar.

| Icon | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ![](tb_1.png) | Saves the current Level Sequence. |
| ![](tb_2.png) | Saves the current Level Sequence under a different name. |
| ![](tb_3.png) | Revert the currently edited movie scene to its last saved state. |
| ![](tb_4.png) | Opens the Render Movie Settings window which allows you to output your sequence as a movie or image sequence. |
| ![](tb_5.png) | Opens the View and Playback Range options.  |
| ![](tb_6.png) | Enables/Disables the Key All option. With this and auto-key enabled, determines if all properties are keyed for a track when changes are made or if only the changed property is keyed. |
| ![](tb_7.png) | Enables/Disables different Auto-Key options. By default, this option is disabled but can be set to Auto-key All or Auto-key Animated. |
| ![](tb_8.png) | Enables/Disables grid snapping for the Keyframe window as well as grid snapping options. |
| ![](tb_9.png) | Allows for adjustment of the time snapping internval. |
| ![](tb_10.png) | Opens the Curve Editor which allows you to fine tune the animation keys placed in the Keyframe window. |

## Sequence Breadcrumbs

Depending on your workflow, you may choose to create several **Level Sequences** as scenes and place each of those scenes in a new Level Sequence which is your "master" Level Sequence which plays those scenes back-to-back as part of a **Shots** track. 
In these instances, you can jump from your master Level Sequence directly into each scene by **Double-clicking** on them inside the Keyframe window. 

In the image below, we have a Level Sequence called _FrostyJumpDown_ inside another Level Sequence called _ExampleTrailer_.

![](SequenceBreadcrumbs1.png)

We can click the _ExampleTrailer_ breadcrumb to return to the "master" Level Sequence containing our _FrostyJumpDown_ Level Sequence.

![](SequenceBreadcrumbs2.png)

Above, our master Level Sequence has several other Level Sequences in it which we can jump into by **Double-clicking** on them. 


## Add / Filter Tracks

The **Add** button allows you to add [**Actors**](Engine/Actors) from your level to **Sequencer** which you can then manipulate. 

![](AddOption.png)

With an Actor in the level selected, clicking the **Add** button will allow you to select it quickly from the menu. If you do not have an Actor selected, you can select one from the **Choose Actor** section. 


You can also add different types of **Tracks** to Sequencer from the **Add** button which will allow you to customize your sequence.

[REGION:note]
Click each of the links below to view a How-to page on using each type of Track.
[/REGION]

| Tracks | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Add Folder | You can add folders to contain your Tracks for organizational purposes.  |
| Audio Track | Adds a master audio track which can be used to play sounds. |
| [**Event Track**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksEvent) | Adds an Event Track which can be used to signal and kick off Blueprint Script (currenlty only in the Level Blueprint). |
| [**Camera Cut Track**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksCameraCut) | Allows you to switch between cameras associated with Sequencer and provide a camera persepctive. |
| [**Shot Track**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksShot) | Allows you to add Level Sequences as "shots" which can have **Takes** that can be swapped in/out. |
| [**Play Rate Track**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksPlayRate) | Adds a track which can be used to manipulate the playback rate of the sequence. |
| [**Sub Track**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksSub) | Adds a sub track which can contain other Level Sequences. This is useful for creating multiple copies of a sequence that different users can work from without altering the original sequence. |
| [**Fade Track**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksFade) | Adds a track that will allow you to control the fading in/out of the sequence.  |
| [**Level Visibility Track**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksLevelVisibility) | This can be used to keyframe and control the visibilty of your level. |

The **Filter** option allows you to filter the **Tracks Window** for only Actors that have been added to the sequence from the level.

## Timeline

![](Timeline.png)

The **Timeline** indicates the playback range of your sequence with **Green** (Start) and **Red** (End) markers. The current time of your sequence is indicated by the Timeline Marker which you can scrub by **Left-click** dragging along the Timeline.

You can **Right-click** on the Timeline to define new Start/Stop points from the context menu as depicted below. 

![](Timeline2.png)

[REGION:tip]
Your sequence will continue to play from the start marker all the way to the end marker even if your content does not full reach the end of the sequence (or exceeds past the end marker). Inside the **General Options**, there is an option to keep your content inside the section bounds which will ensure there is no dead space during your sequence. 

![](KeepInSectionBounds.png)

## Tracks Window

The **Tracks** window is where you determine what types of actions you want to perform during your sequence. 

![](tracks1.png)

Above we have a **Camera Cuts** track for switching camera angles during our sequence, two **Camera Actors** to provide the views, and a **Skeletal Mesh Actor** which is our character that we have in our scene. 
Both Camera Actors have a **Sub-Track** added to them called **Transform** which allows us to move the camera around during the scene. 
The Skeletal Mesh (SK_Mannequin) Actor also has a Transform track so that we can move them around in the scene as well as an **Animation** track which we can use to determine the animation for the Actor to play at any given time during our scene. 

Sequencer is context sensitive and will allow you to add Sub-Tracks (where applicable) to each track that you add which will provide you with addition options that you can adjust during your scene. 
For example, in the image below we have added a **CameraComponent** track to our Camera Actor Track which gives us the ability to add another Sub-Track to adjust some of the properties of the camera during our scene if we desire. 

![](tracks2.png)

You can also add Keyframes from the Tracks Window for your tracks to define properties at a specific point on the Timeline.

![](AddKeyFrameButton.png)

You can click the **+** keyframe button or press the **Enter** key with a Track selected. 


## Keyframe Window

![](KeyframeWindow.png)

They **Keyframe** Window is where you adjust the content in each of your Tracks. You can adjust any keyframes you have added, trim/split or taper in/out of sections as well as several other options that are available from the **Right-click** context menu (pictured below). 

![](RightClickContext1.png)

Above, **Right-clicking** on a keyframe for a Transformation track gives the ability to change the key interpolation type as well as other options that can be adjusted from the **Properties** roll-out which updates based on the type of content your Right-click on. 
Below, Right-clicking on an Animation assigned to an Animation Track and selecting properties gives us the ability to change the currently assigned animation as well as adjust properties related to the animation itself such as start/end offsets and play rate and more. 

![](RightClickProperties.png)

### Navigating the Keyframe Window

Below are methods and shortcuts you can use to navigate the Keyframe window. 

| Command | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **_Right-click Drag_** | Allows you to move around the drag the keyframe window around. |
| **_Left-click Drag_** | Creates a selection box around keys in the window. |

| **_Shift + R_** with a Track selected | Adds a Transform Sub-Track (if it does not exist) and adds a key for Scale only. |



## Playback Controls

![](PlaybackControls.png)

The **Playback Controls** can be found in the bottom lower-left corner of the Sequencer Editor and are similar to standard media player applications. With the default Unreal Editor layout, there is also the same playback controls displayed in the main Level Viewport. Finally, when using a [Cinematic Viewport](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\ViewportOptions), the playback controls will appear inside the viewport. 

Standard Playback Controls are as follows: 

| Command | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ![](playback1.png) | Set the playback start position to the current position indicated by the Time Marker. |
| ![](playback2.png) | Jump to the playback start position. |
| ![](playback3.png) | Jump to the previous key in the selected track(s).|
| ![](playback4.png) | Jump to the previous frame. |
| ![](playback5.png) | Play or Pause the Level Sequence from the position of the Time Marker. s|
| ![](playback6.png) | Jump forward a frame. |
| ![](playback7.png) | Jump to the next key in the selected track(s).|
| ![](playback8.png) | Jump to the playback end position. |
| ![](playback9.png) | Set the playback end position to the current position indicated by the Time Marker. |
| ![](playback10.png) | Loop the Level Sequence during playback from the playback start and playback end positions. |

[REGION:note]
You will notice that the same keys are provided inside the Cinematic Viewport to which the controls are the same.
