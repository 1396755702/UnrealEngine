In the following section we will create a new level and all of the required Actors the Grass Tool requires to function correctly inside of a UE4 level.

1. First create a new level inside UE4 by going to the **Main Toolbar** then going to **File** and clicking on the **New Level** option. When prompted pick the **Default Template** as a base level.

1. After the new level has loaded, add a new Landscape actor to the level by first clicking on the **Landscape Tool** icon and then pressing the **Create** button to add the Landscape Actor to the level.

1. Next in the **Landscape Tools** under the **Landscape Editor** section click on the **Sculpt Tool** icon to expose the available tools then pick the **Noise** tool from the tool list and adjust the following properties with the following values.

	* **Brush Size:** 65536.0
	* **Tool Strength:** 0.01
	* ** Noise Scale:** 256

1. Now position the Landscape Brush in the viewport so that it covers the entire Landscape Terrain then click the **Left Mouse Button**	three to four times to add some very subtle noise to the Landscape surface. 
	When completed you should have something that looks similar to the following image.

1. Finally save your work and level by pressing the **Save All** button to save all content and the ** Save** button to save the level. 
	When prompted for a level name use the name **GT_00**.
