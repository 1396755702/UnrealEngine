## Overview

As with anything in life using the right tool for the job is often the determining factor between success and failure and the same can be said when talking about the Open World tools inside of UE4. 
For example the Procedural Foliage tool is great at simulating huge forests that are composed of many different species of trees and bushes. 
However if you try and use the Procedural Foliage tool to make the Landscape Terrain look like it was densely covered in grass or flowers you will quickly find out that getting the results you want can be very time consuming. 
To address this issue and give you the ability to densely spawn grass and flowers the Open World Tools have an optional tool called the **Grass Tool**.
The Grass Tool allows you to define a Static Mesh to spawn wherever a certain Texture is painted on the Landscape terrain.
In the following Quick Start we will cover all you need to know about using the Grass Tool in your levels.

Currently the Grass system will only work with the Landscape Terrain Actor. Trying to use the Grass system to spawn grass on any other Actor type will not work.
