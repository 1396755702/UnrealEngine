%Steps%

In the following section we will be creating the required Actors and Materials the Grass Tool needs to function correctly.
We will continue to work with the **GT_00** level that was created in the last step so if you have closed down this level please re-open it before going any further.

1. The first thing we need to do is to create a **Landscape Grass Type** which will tell our Landscape which Static Mesh to spawn and the amount it should spawn. 
	To do this **Right - Click** with the Mouse in the **Content Browser** and from the menu that is displayed go to **Create Advanced Asset** > **Miscellaneous** > **Landscape Grass Type** and then give it a name of **Grass_00**.

1. Next open up the Landscape Grass Type by **Double - Clicking** on it with the **Left Mouse button** and 
	once opened add a new item to the **Grass Varieties** array by pressing the **Plus** icon that is to the right of the **Grass Varieties** name.

1. Now look for the **Grass Mesh** section and then click on the input box that says **None** then search for **SM_FieldGrass_01** Static Mesh by entering **SM_FieldGrass_01** as the search term.

1. Once the Static Mesh has been added make sure the following properties are enabled.

	* **Grass Density:** 400.0
	* **Use Grid:** Enabled
	* **Random Rotation:** Enabled
	* **Align to Surface:** Enabled
