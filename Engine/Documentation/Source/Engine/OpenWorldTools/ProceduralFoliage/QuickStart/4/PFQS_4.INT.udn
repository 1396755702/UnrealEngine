Having a single species of tree does not make our virtual forest look very interesting nor realistic. 
Luckily for us the **Procedural Foliage Spawner** allows for you to spawn multiple **Foliage Types** resulting in one single **Procedural Foliage Spawner** being able to spawn an entire forest with a multitude of different trees. 
In the following section we will take a look at how you can set up a Procedural Foliage Spawner to work with multiple Foliage Types.
We will be continuing to work with the **PFT_00** level that was used in the last step.
If you have closed down this level please re-open before going any further.

1. First inside of the **Content Browser** select the **Tree_00** Foliage Type by clicking on it with the mouse then press **Ctrl + W** on the Keyboard to duplicate it and name it **Tree_01**.

1. Then open the newly created **Tree_01** Foliage Type up and under the **Mesh** section change the mesh to the **ScotsPineTall_01** Static Mesh.

1. Next open up the **Procedural Foliage Spawner** from the **Content Browser** and expand the **Foliage Types** section.

1. Now click on the **Plus** sign icon to add the option to input another Foliage Type.

1. Next from the **Content Browser** select the **Tree_01** Foliage Type and then in the Procedural Foliage Spawner under the **Foliage Types** add the **Tree_01** Foliage Type to the empty **Foliage Type Object** by pressing the white **Arrow** icon.

1. Then select the **Procedural Foliage Spawner** that was placed in the level and press the **Resimulate** button and you should now have something that looks like this in your level.

1. While this does look very interesting the results could be better. Open up the **Tree_01** Foliage Type and adjust the following settings.
	* **Num Steps:** 4
	* **Initial Seed Density:** 0.125
	* **Average Spread Distance:** 100
	* **Can Grow in Shade:** Enabled
	* **Spawns in Shade:** Enabled
	* **Max Age:** 15
	* **Overlap Priority:** 1
	* **Procedural Scale:** Max 5.0

1. Once the settings have been adjusted press the **Re-Simulate** button on the Procedural Foliage Spawner.

1. Finally make sure to save all of you work by pressing both the **Save All** and **Save** buttons.
