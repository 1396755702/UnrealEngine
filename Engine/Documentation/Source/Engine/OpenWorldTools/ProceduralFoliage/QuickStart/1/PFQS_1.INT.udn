In the following How To we will create a new Level, Landscape Terrain and all of Actors the Procedural Foliage Tool requires to function correctly inside UE4.


1. First create a new level inside UE4 using the **Default Template** as a base.

1. After the new level has loaded, add a new Landscape actor to the level by first clicking on the **Landscape Tool** icon and then pressing the **Create** button to add the Landscape Actor to the level.

1. Once the Landscape has been added to the level exit the Landscape tool by clicking on the **Place** icon in the **Modes Panel**.

	[region:note]
	The reason we are using a Landscape Terrain this is because the Landscape Terrain Actor quickly provides us with a very large area to spawn lots of Static Meshes on.

1. Next create a new Procedural Foliage Spawner by **Right- Clicking** in the **Content Browser** with the mouse and going to the **Create Advanced Asset** menu option then **Miscellaneous** > **Procedural Foliage Spawner**.

1. Then drag the Procedural Foliage Spawner from the **Content Browser** into the level and position it so that it is at **0,0,200** in the level then scale Procedural Foliage Spawner to **100,100,10** in the X, Y and Z Axis.
