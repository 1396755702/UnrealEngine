In the following section we will cover how to set up the **Foliage Type Actors** to work with the Procedural Foliage Spawner. 
We will continue to work with the **PFT_00** level that was created in the last step so if you have closed down this level please re-open it before going any further.

1. First open up the **Procedural Foliage Spawner** by **Double - Clicking** on it with the **Left Mouse Button** inside of the Content Browser.
