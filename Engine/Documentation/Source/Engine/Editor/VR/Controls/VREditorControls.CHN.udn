## Laser Pointer

Each Controller emits a beam called the laser pointer which is used to determine which Actor you will interact with.  The color of the beam indicates the interaction mode the controller is in.

| Color | Appearance | Meaning |
| ----- | ---------- | ------- |
| Red |![](standardmode.png)(w:192) | The controller is in the standard interaction mode. This is the default state for the controller. |
| Green |![](selectionmode.png)(w:192) | The controller is in selection mode, meaning it currently has an Actor selected.  |
| Yellow |![](movementmode.png)(w:192) | The controller is in movement mode, meaning it is being used to navigate the world. |
