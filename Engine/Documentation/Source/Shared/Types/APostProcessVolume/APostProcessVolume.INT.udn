Description:Overview of the PostProcessVolume class

[EXCERPT:APostProcessVolume]

The PostProcessVolume is a special type of volume that can be added to a level. Currently Unreal Engine 4 does not make use of post processing chains, making PostProcessVolumes the only way to manipulate post processing parameters.
