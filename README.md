Unreal Engine
=============

Welcome to the Unreal Engine source code! 

From this repository you can build the Unreal Editor for Windows and Mac, compile Unreal Engine games for Android, iOS, Playstation 4, Xbox One, HTML5 and Linux,
and build tools like Unreal Lightmass and Unreal Frontend. Modify them in any way you can imagine, and share your changes with others! 

We have a heap of documentation available for the engine on the web. If you're looking for the answer to something, you may want to start here: 

* [Unreal Engine Programming Guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/index.html)
* [Unreal Engine API Reference](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/index.html)
* [Engine source and GitHub on the Unreal Engine forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/forumdisplay.php?1-Development-Discussion)

If you need more, just ask. A lot of Epic developers hang out on the [forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/) or [AnswerHub](https://answers.unrealengine.com/), 
and we're proud to be part of a well-meaning, friendly and welcoming community of thousands. 


Branches
--------

We publish source for the engine in three rolling branches:

The **[release branch](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/release)** is extensively tested by our QA team and makes a great starting point for learning the engine or
making your own games. We work hard to make releases stable and reliable, and aim to publish new releases every 1-2 months.

The **[promoted branch](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/promoted)** branch is updated with builds for our artists and designers to use. We try to update it daily, though we often
catch things that prevent us from doing so, and it's a good balance between getting the latest cool stuff and knowing most things work.

The **[master branch](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/tree/master)** branch tracks [live changes](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/commits/master) by our engine team. This is the cutting edge and may be buggy - it may not even 
compile. Battle-hardened developers eager to work lock-step with us on the latest and greatest should head here.


Getting up and running
----------------------

The steps below will take you through cloning your own private fork, then compiling and running the editor yourself:

### Windows

1. Install **[GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/)** then **fork our repository** and **clone it to your computer**. 
   If you'd rather use Git from the command line, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.
   If you'd prefer not to use Git at all, you can get the source as a zip file using the 'Download ZIP' button on the right.

1. Make sure you have **Visual Studio 2013** installed.
   Any desktop edition of Visual Studio 2013 will do, including the free version: [Visual Studio 2013 Express for Windows Desktop](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40787).

1. Open your source folder in Explorer and run **Setup.bat**. This will download binary content for the engine, as well as installing prerequisites
   and setting up Unreal file associations. On Windows 8, a warning from SmartScreen may appear.  Click "More info", then "Run anyway" to continue.
   
   A clean download of the engine binaries is currently around 2.5gb, which may take some time to complete on a slow internet connection.
   Subsequent checkouts only require incremental downloads and will be much quicker.
 
1. Run **GenerateProjectFiles.bat** to create project files for the engine. It should take less than a minute to complete.  

1. Load the project into Visual Studio by double-clicking on the **UE4.sln** file. Set your solution configuration to **Development Editor** and your solution
   platform to **Win64**, then right click on the **UE4** target and select **Build**. It may take anywhere between 10 and 40 minutes to finish compiling, depending on your system specs.

1. After compiling finishes, you can load the editor from Visual Studio by setting your startup project to **UE4** and pressing **F5** to debug.




### Mac
   
1. Install **[GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/)** then **fork our repository** and **clone it to your computer**. 
   To use Git from the Terminal, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles. 
   Or if you'd rather not use Git at all, use the 'Download ZIP' button on the right to get the source as a zip file.

1. Install the latest version of [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).

1. Open your source folder in Finder and run **Setup.command** to download binary content for the engine.

1. You'll need project files in order to compile.  In the _UnrealEngine_ folder, double-click on **GenerateProjectFiles.command**.  It should take less than a minute to complete.  You can close the Terminal window afterwards.  If you downloaded the source in .zip format, you may see a warning about an unidentified developer.  This is because because the .zip files on GitHub are not digitally signed.  To work around this, right-click on GenerateProjectFiles.command, select Open, then click the Open button if you are sure you want to open it.

1. Load the project into Xcode by double-clicking on the **UE4.xcodeproj** file.

1. It's time to **compile the editor**!  In Xcode, build the **UE4Editor - Mac** target for **My Mac** by selecting it in the target drop down
   in the top left, then using **Product** -> **Build For** -> **Running**.  It will take between 15 and 40 minutes, depending on your system specs.

1. After compiling finishes, you can **load the editor** from Xcode using the **Product** -> **Run** menu command!




### Linux

1. [Set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [fork our repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
   If you'd prefer not to use Git, use the 'Download ZIP' button on the right to get the source as a zip file.

1. Open your source folder and run **Setup.sh** to download binary content for the engine.

1. Both cross-compiling and native builds are supported. 

   **Cross-compiling** is handy when you are a Windows (Mac support planned too) developer who wants to package your game for Linux with minimal hassle, and it requires a [cross-compiler toolchain](http://cdn.unrealengine.com/qfe/v4_clang-3.5.0_ld-2.24_glibc-2.12.2.zip) to be installed (see the [Linux cross-compiling page on the wiki](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Compiling_For_Linux)).

   **Native compilation** is discussed in [a separate README](Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/README.md) and [community wiki page](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Building_On_Linux). Downloading the dependencies has now been automated, so you will only need to clone the repo and run **GenerateProjectFiles.sh** (provided that you have OAUTH_TOKEN set to your personal access token, see the above README for details).




### Additional target platforms

**Android** support will be downloaded by the setup script if you have the Android NDK installed. See the [Android getting started guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/Android/GettingStarted/).

**iOS** programming requires a Mac. Instructions are in the [iOS getting started guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/iOS/GettingStarted/index.html).

**HTML5** support will be downloaded by the setup script if you have Emscripten installed. Please see the [HTML5 getting started guide](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/HTML5/GettingStarted/index.html).

**Playstation 4** or **XboxOne** development require additional files that can only be provided after your registered developer status is confirmed by Sony or Microsoft. See [the announcement blog post](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/playstation-4-and-xbox-one-now-supported) for more information.



Additional Notes
----------------

Visual Studio 2012 is supported by the Windows toolchain, though Visual Studio 2013 is recommended.

The first time you start the editor from a fresh source build, you may experience long load times. 
The engine is optimizing content for your platform to the _derived data cache_, and it should only happen once.

Your private forks of the Unreal Engine code are associated with your GitHub account permissions.
If you unsubscribe or switch GitHub user names, you'll need to re-fork and upload your changes from a local copy.
